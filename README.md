# Algorithms-and-Data-structures
This is a mandartory course "Algorithms and Data structures" from ITU of the Software Development track 

Kursusnavn (dansk):	Algoritmer og datastruktures
Kursusnavn (engelsk):	Algorithms and Data Structures
Semester:	Forår 2016

Formelle forudsætninger: Basic ability to program in some imperative programming language (Java, Python, C/C++/C#, etc.), 
using conditions, loops, arrays, methods/procedures/functions, simple recursion and abstract data types (interfaces).
This is normally obtained by following the first semester undergraduate course Grundlæggende Programmering (GPP).
Knowledge of basic mathematical concepts like: sets, functions, graphs, and trees, arithmetic and geometric series. 

Information om studiestruktur

    Discuss and clearly explain the mechanics of computations and data structures involving manipulation of references, nested loops and recursion, specified in natural language, in abstract pseudocode or in concrete programming language (Java).

    Implement abstractly specified computations and data structures in an imperative programming language (Java).

    Analyze time and space usage of algorithms/programs.

    Assess scalability of a given single-threaded software application, using asymptotic analysis.

    Choose among and make use of the most important algorithms and data structures in libraries, based on knowledge of their complexity.

    Design algorithms for ad hoc problems by using and combining known algorithms and data structures.

    Describe the most important hardware and programming language factors influencing the speed at which a program runs and take them into account in assessment of speed of algorithms. .

Topics covered are among others complexity analysis, big-O, algorithmic problem solving techniques including divide-and-conquer, concrete algorithms and data structures for search trees, sorting, hashing, graphs, shortest paths.

Activities
The course has 8 mandatory programming assignments.
